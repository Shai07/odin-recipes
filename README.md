# odin-recipes

In this recipes project I am attempting to apply the skills I learned from the Odin Project to
create a simple Recipes Website.

Skills Used to create this project:
I demonstrated an ability to organize and access multiple directories, accessing different webpages and images.
I used ordered and unordered lists to list directions, ingredients, and list of recipes.
I used links to allow for easy navigation between recipes.
I added images to provide visual representation of the recipes.
I utilized different levels of headers to highlight the different categories of ingredients.
